# decision-tree

A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure used to make decisions or predictions. It consists of nodes representing decisions or tests on attributes, branches representing the outcome of these decisions, and leaf nodes representing final outcomes or predictions. Each internal node corresponds to a test on an attribute, each branch corresponds to the result of the test, and each leaf node corresponds to a class label or a continuous value.
